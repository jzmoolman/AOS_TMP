Question 1 
-----------

Middleware are software that is place on top of the respective operating system
of the computer that is part of the system.  The middleware provide the
distributed  application a single interface to communicate with each other.  At
the same time it hides the implementation of the different hardware.  The
middleware acts as an operating system does for a computer.  Is manage resources
across the network. Furthermore, it also offer the following functions:
1. inter application communications
2. security services
3. accounting services
4. masking of and recovery from failures

Question 2
----------

The system appears as a single coherent system

|Transparency| Description|
|:---|:-----|
| Access | Hides the differences in data structure |
| Location | Hides where data is located |
| Relocation | Hides if data is moved |
| Migration | Hides when data is moved |
| Replication | Hides objects are replicated |
| Concurrency | Hides that objects might be shared |
| Failure | Hides failure and recovery |

Question 3
----------

Same failures are hard to distinguish, for example, dead process and a very
painfully slow responding one.  Other failures are by it own nature unavoidable
and you can't recover from them.

Question 4
----------

There exit two techniques:
1. Simply improving capacity - increasing memory, upgrading CPU; called scaling
   up
2. By using distributed systems, using multiple computers/machines; called
   scaling out

Question 5
----------

 We will see more sensors bing built into cellphones and other smart devices
 such as watches. All of these devices will be connected together to enhance 
 features such as health information.  Furthermore, these will migrate virtual
 reality. 

 However, I see that in the next 10 years more of these devices will make there
 way into the human body as these devices get smaller, enhancing the humans
 capabilities.  These devices will integrate with each other in a distributed
 manor to take leverage of each device own feature but work in union.
